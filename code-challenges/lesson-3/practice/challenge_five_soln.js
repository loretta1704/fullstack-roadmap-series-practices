//Code here
const myArray = [20, 30, 40];

console.log(myArray[3]);

//This code is valid but the console.log requirements are inavlid because the variable myArray has only 3 instaead of 4 indexes sated above so it's supposed to be console.log(myArray[2]) since it counts from index 0 so the outputnis 40.

//Corrected console.log
console.log(myArray[2]);
